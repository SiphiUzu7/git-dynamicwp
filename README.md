# Dynamic Coders Project

This project, created for **Dynamic Coders**, involved building a custom WooCommerce storefront using WordPress. I customised the Astra theme, added product grids, a blog section, and integrated the PayFast payment gateway. Custom CSS was applied for hover effects, responsiveness, and a unique loading spinner, enhancing user experience and design.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

While building this project, I deepened my understanding of WordPress, especially in customizing themes. Initially, I struggled with theme appearance customisation but overcame it by using class names to manually style elements. Eventually, I figured out how to apply changes globally, improving efficiency. I also learned how to use Git commands, which was challenging at first because I thought my keyboard wasn't working when entering the password. I also had to figure out how to fetch the GitHub public access token to link WordPress and GitHub. Although it was not many but I had a sleepless night, but I managed to finish it, and overall, I really enjoyed the project! Thank you!
