# Dynamic Coders Project

This project, created for **Dynamic Coders**, involved building a custom WooCommerce storefront using WordPress. I customised the Astra theme, added product grids, a blog section, and integrated the PayFast payment gateway. Custom CSS was applied for hover effects, responsiveness, and a unique loading spinner, enhancing user experience and design.
